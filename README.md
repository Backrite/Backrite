# Backrite  

Backrite is a **backend-focused practice platform** that helps developers strengthen their backend engineering and problem-solving skills. Unlike traditional coding platforms that primarily emphasize algorithms, Backrite provides a **real-world backend environment** where users can implement, and validate their Backend knowledge.

## 💡 Why Backrite?  
Backend developers often lack platforms to practice **real-world backend challenges**. Backrite bridges this gap by:  
- Providing a **production-like coding environment** using **Docker**.  
- Allowing users to practice backend-specific tasks like API building and request handling.  
- Offering **real-time feedback** via automated test case validation.  
- Enabling developers to gain confidence in writing, deploying, and debugging backend solutions.  

This makes Backrite not just a coding platform, but a **career-oriented backend practice tool**.
